    fin.open("Story.txt");
   
    char str[100];
    int count=0;
    int count1=0;
   
    while(!fin.eof())
    {
        fin.getline(str,100);
        if(str[0]!='A')
        {
            count++;
        }
        else if(str[0]=='A'&&str[1]==' ')
        {

        }
    }
   
    cout<<"The number of lines not starting with 'A' are:"<<count<<"\n";
